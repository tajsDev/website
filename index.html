                      "Golf-N-Stuff" represents a collaborative software engineering project undertaken by a team of five individuals, including myself. In the context of this project, my primary responsibilities encompassed level design and the implementation of specific game mechanics.

                        In the realm of level design, my objective was to create multi-path courses that not only encourage players to demonstrate their skill but also provide alternative, more accessible routes. This design approach aimed to offer a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. To further enhance the challenge and player engagement, I introduced various obstacles strategically placed throughout the levels, requiring players to employ a higher degree of precision and strategy in their putting.

                        Within this project, I took charge of developing six distinct levels, each of which was meticulously designed to strike a balance between challenging gameplay and the number of putts required for successful completion. In addition to conceptualizing these levels, I also undertook the creation of the terrain for four of them, each exhibiting a unique theme.

                        The selected themes for these levels encompassed a beach and castle motif, with the intention of visually and thematically representing an incremental increase in difficulty. This thematic variation not only added depth to the gameplay but also allowed for a more immersive and rewarding gaming&nbsp;experience.

                      "Apple Picker" stands as one of my earliest independent game development projects, representing a straightforward yet engaging gaming experience. The game's primary objective is to challenge players in collecting apples from a tree using their mouse, with the twist of randomized apple movement and spawn patterns.

                        In its initial and easiest difficulty setting, the game offers a fundamental experience, featuring the core mechanics with a total of five lives allocated to the player.

                        In the medium difficulty level, I introduced a green apple into the gameplay. This special apple element poses a risk to players as it inflicts damage upon contact, thereby depleting their limited pool of lives. A mere touch of this green apple puts the player's progress in jeopardy.

                        For the most challenging difficulty setting, I added a black apple, designed to deliver an instant and unforgiving blow to the player upon contact. In this mode, players were granted only three lives, intensifying the stakes and the gameplay experience.

                        The ultimate goal of "Apple Picker" is to achieve the highest score possible, adding a competitive and high-score chasing element to the gameplay.

                        To adhere to a thematic approach reminiscent of retro Atari games, I deliberately omitted the use of shadows and opted for minimalistic asset design using simple boxes. This design choice seeks to evoke nostalgia and encapsulate the essence of classic gaming experiences from the past.

                      The project I am currently working on is a top-down shooter that offers players the opportunity to engage in action-packed combat scenarios, where they face off against swarms of adversaries and powerful bosses. As part of the development process, I have been focusing on crafting a diverse array of enemies and formidable bosses to intensify the gameplay experience.

                    To enhance the intelligence and behaviors of these entities, I have implemented the AI NavMesh agent and experimented with various methods to trigger enemy attacks. These efforts are aimed at creating dynamic and challenging combat encounters, adding depth to the game's mechanics.

                    As for the technical aspect of the project, I have been conscientiously employing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizing composition to create distinct classes that govern the health and attack attributes of both the player character and the enemy units. This approach facilitates code modularity and maintainability, allowing for efficient management of game elements.

                    The inspiration for this game draws from the captivating gameplay experiences of titles such as "Risk of Rain 2" and "20 Minutes Until Dawn." These games serve as a source of creative influence, contributing to the development of a rich and engaging gaming environment.

                    The project is progressing steadily, and I anticipate that a final prototype will be available for playtesting in November. This prototype will offer players a glimpse of the game's mechanics and overall concept, inviting them to immerse themselves in this thrilling top-down shooter experience.

                        The project I&#39;m currently involved in is dedicated to transforming the act of walking into an
                        enjoyable and engaging experience for children who have cerebral palsy. This initiative will
                        leverage the innovative exoskeleton technology developed by Biomotum to serve as the primary
                        input method for a mobile game.
                        At the present stage of development, my focus is primarily on crafting the structure and
                        framework of both the mobile application and the game itself. Extensive research is being
                        conducted to determine the most suitable game engine for this project, a crucial decision that
                        will influence the game&#39;s performance and accessibility.
                        The ultimate aim of this undertaking is to create a mobile game that seamlessly integrates with
                        the Biomotum exoskeleton, providing an interactive and entertaining walking experience for
                        children with cerebral palsy.
                        The project is progressing towards a technical demo that is expected to be ready for
                        presentation in November. This demo will offer a glimpse into the technical aspects of the game
                        and how it interacts with the Biomotum exoskeleton, setting the stage for a more inclusive and
                        enjoyable walking experience for children facing mobility challenges.

                      While pursuing my studies, I've also actively pursued my interests through various clubs and organizations. While software development remains a significant passion of mine, I have a deep-rooted commitment to supporting the Latino community. This commitment has led me to take on the role of Community Outreach Coordinator for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (S.H.P.E). In this capacity, I've been able to forge meaningful relationships with companies, enhancing our club's presence at Northern Arizona University (NAU).
                      One of my initial accomplishments was establishing a partnership with General Dynamics, which included hosting meetings and providing financial support for our club's participation in the national S.H.P.E convention. I am currently working on fostering additional relationships with other companies. My primary objective within S.H.P.E is to create a platform where corporations and Hispanic students in STEM can connect, enabling these companies to recognize the immense value that these individuals bring to the field.

          <h3>Hi,</h3><p>
            I'm Tomas Jauregui, currently a third-year student majoring in Software Engineering with a specific focus on Game Design. My journey into the world of game creation began during my middle school years, and it was in high school that I first dived into the fascinating realm of coding. Fueled by a profound passion for both game development and programming, I made the resolute decision to pursue a career in software engineering.
            
            Family plays a pivotal role in my life, as my roots extend to both Peru and Venezuela. Their unwavering support has been a cornerstone of my career development, alongside my academic pursuits. In addition to my studies, I'm deeply committed to creating a more inclusive space, which is why I'm an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
            
            My overarching goal is to earn my master's degree and enter the game industry, with aspirations of climbing the ranks to become a game director. The driving force behind my endeavors is the desire to bring joy and unique experiences to players. I find immense satisfaction in crafting and sharing my creative creations with people, making the journey in game development all the more rewarding. </p>
